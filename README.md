# Sonic the Hedgehog: Isle of Magnetic Artifacts ROM Archive

A collection of ROMs documenting the development of SHIMA. It contains every playtesting
build released by the team, as well as compiled ROMs for each day of SHIMA's development,
dating from when the hack started all the way back in December 2020, to the hack's public
source release in September of 2025, asnd a few extra builds which allow you to enjoy
SHIMA's music freely from the period of development where the sound test wasn't functional.

### Internal

ROMs built directly from the source repositories for SHIMA.

### Playtesting

ROMs posted in the SHIMA Discord server for playtesters (and server members (early on)) to
play.

### SHC Crunch

ROMs built from every commit for the final week(ish) before the SHC2022 deadline. Includes LOTS of changes done in such a short amount of time.
