### FOLDER DESCRIPTIONS

#### S2_MENU_MOD

Builds dated 2021.11.24-2021.12.23 where the S2 Menu was replaced with
what would eventually become the final game's menu. At this point, the
sound test was rendered completely innaccessible. This folder contains
mods done by DaxKatter to restore the sound test (either by replacing
the new menu entirely in earlier builds, or by making the Sound Test
option point to the S2 Menu)

#### YOULIKEJAZZ_FIX

Builds dated from 2021.12.28-2022.02.12 where a build option to replace
the new options menu with the S2 Menu was added. However, due to some
changes in ram allocation, these ROMs never actually worked and would
cause address errors on hardware and accurate emulators. These ROMs fix
these errors and allow you to access the S2 Menu and listen to the music.

#### SOUNDTEST_ROM

External Sound Test ROMs that allow you to freely listen to the music of
the hack at the date of the builds mentioned. Built directly from the
source code with no modifications.
